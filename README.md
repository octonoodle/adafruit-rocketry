# adafruit-rocketry: lightweight drivers for a compact avionics system

this repository hold the software for my hobby rockets' avionics systems.

it's mostly just (1) the code for the onboard avionics/transmitter and (2) the code for the ground receiver.

# hardware

the onboard avionics consist of:
- ~~Adafruit Feather M0 Express (<https://adafru.it/3403>)~~ *retired (read: lost in a field somewhere)*
- Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2 (<https://adafru.it/5000>)
- Adafruit BMP390 Altimiter (<https://adafru.it/4816>)
- Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing (<https://adafru.it/3133>)
- Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio FeatherWing (<https://adafru.it/3231>)
- *soon to be incorporated:* Adafruit ADXL375 200g High-G Accelerometer (<https://adafru.it/5374>)

and the ground reciever is just an Adafruit Feather M0 with integrated LoRa radio (<https://adafru.it/3178>).

# future ideas

- accelerometer data
- companion GUIs with Processing
- robotics and active control
