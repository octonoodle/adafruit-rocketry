# adafruit-rocketry: lightweight drivers for a compact avionics system

this repository hold the software for my hobby rockets' avionics systems. it mostly consists of (1) a program for an onboard transmitter and (2) a program for a ground receiver.

# hardware

the onboard avionics consist of:
-Adafruit Feather M0 Express (<https://adafru.it/3403>)
-Adafruit BMP390 Altimiter (<https://adafru.it/4816>)
-Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing (<https://adafru.it/3133>)
-Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio FeatherWing (<https://adafru.it/3231>)
-*soon to be incorporated:* Adafruit (https://adafru.it/5374>)

while the ground reciever is just an Adafruit Feather M0 with integrated LoRa (<https://adafru.it/3178>).

# future ideas

-accelerometer data
-companion GUIs with Processing
-robotics and active control
